1. Verify Server Configuration
Ensure that your WebSocket server is properly set up and running on port 3002. Check the server logs for any error messages related to WebSocket connections.
2. Check Network Settings
Verify that firewalls or proxies are not blocking WebSocket traffic on port 3002.
If you're behind a corporate network, consult with your IT department to allow WebSocket connections.
3. SSL/TLS Configuration
Ensure that your SSL/TLS certificates are valid and properly configured on the server.
Verify that the server's hostname matches the one in the SSL certificate.
4. CORS Configuration
Configure your server to allow WebSocket connections from your client's origin. Add appropriate CORS headers to your server response:
javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const server = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 3002 });

server.on('connection', (ws, req) => {
  const origin = req.headers.origin;
  if (isAllowedOrigin(origin)) {
    ws.send('Connection established');
  } else {
    ws.close();
  }
});

function isAllowedOrigin(origin) {
  // Implement your origin validation logic here
  return true; // For testing purposes
}
5. Implement Error Handling
Improve your client-side error handling to provide more information about the connection failure:
javascript
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://bd2aa3d1-3dab-4028-9a2d-21d614e35d41-00-34az0xc50c0z0.janeway.replit.dev:3002/ws/projects/7/chat');

socket.onerror = (error) => {
  console.error('WebSocket Error:', error);
  // Implement reconnection logic or user notification here
};

socket.onclose = (event) => {
  console.log('WebSocket connection closed:', event.code, event.reason);
  // Implement reconnection logic or user notification here
};
6. Check Browser Console
Examine the browser's console for any additional error messages or warnings that might provide more context about the connection failure.
7. Verify URL
Double-check that the WebSocket URL is correct and accessible:
javascript
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://bd2aa3d1-3dab-4028-9a2d-21d614e35d41-00-34az0xc50c0z0.janeway.replit.dev:3002/ws/projects/7/chat');
Ensure that this URL is reachable and that the server is expecting connections on this endpoint.
By implementing these solutions and performing thorough debugging, you should be able to resolve the WebSocket connection error and establish a stable connection between your client and server.
